## About Me

I am an adaptable and driven cybersecurity enthusiast with a solid foundation in computer science and hands-on experience in cybersecurity projects. My passion lies in creating secure systems, analyzing threats, and deploying effective solutions to protect information and infrastructure. Dedicated to continuous learning, I am constantly expanding my knowledge to deliver value in the IT and cybersecurity fields.

With proficiency in both Linux and Windows environments, I have honed my skills in vulnerability management, threat detection, and incident response. Through academic and personal projects, I have gained practical experience in end-to-end SOC simulations, honeypot deployment, cloud security implementation, and malware analysis. My expertise also extends to tools like Splunk, ELK Stack, and Nessus, as well as programming languages such as Python, Bash, and Java.  

Currently working towards earning my Network+ and Security+ certifications, I am eager to bring my technical expertise and problem-solving mindset to challenging cybersecurity roles. Whether designing secure systems, detecting threats, or responding to incidents, I thrive on the opportunity to make a meaningful impact in protecting digital assets.
